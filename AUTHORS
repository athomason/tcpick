This is AUTHORS, produced by makeinfo version 4.7 from AUTHORS.texinfo.

Francesco Stablum duskdruid:despammed.com
*****************************************

Mantainer

Artyom Khafizov
***************

Bugfixes and memory leak fixes, added RESET and EXPIRED status
detection, added a new way to write the stream to files, using
directories.

Federico Castaneda F_CASTANEDA:crm.com.ar
*****************************************

Added basic UDP support

Buck Huppmann buckh:pobox.com
*****************************

wrote the RESET status detection

Saumil Shah
***********

has helped me improving tcpick and making it useful to decode
application-level data (i.e. http).

Gianluigi Spagnuolo, kirash
***************************

has tested tcpick under many *BSD systems, helping me to make tcpick
more compatible on other systems.  He found also the pcap_next bug and
a bug on the inet_ntoa return ointer.  Kirash is currently helping me
with several patches and increasing the tcpick portability, which is
really very important.

Penelope Fudd
*************

Added a patch that allows to process with tcpick a tcpdump output file
instead of a live connection, in that way:

     % tcpdump -n -s 1600 -w /tmp/foo.tcpdump
     % tcpick -r /tmp/foo.tcpdump

mainman
*******

helped me to improve the performance of tcpick suggesting me a method
of session recognization with hash generated by addresses and ports and
a "chained" tracker of structures instead of a block of addresses to
structures (i.e. conn_ptr->next_conn).

Sebastian Prause
****************

added support for DLT_PPP_ETHER datalink type (including pppoe for
NetBSD systems).

ShackaN
*******

wrote a nice dprintf function for debugging purposes :)

Gimli
*****

Spent a lot of time seeking for a bug I couldn't resolve on a free().

kain
****

bug found at pcap_next, that returns NULL on some systems suggested me
to change pcap #include directive, because on trustix (and perhaps
other linux systems) libpcap are located in a different place
(pcap/pcap.h).

Ardoino Paolo
*************

Suggested me to control memory allocated addresses

Robert Scheck
*************

suggested me to improve the Makefile with variables.

Alberto 'JCN-9000' Varesio:
***************************

found that AIX doesn't have getopt_long and getopt.h

Davide Benini
*************

corrected bug in calling S_calloc with only one argument

Packagers

   Lou Afonso has compiled version 0.1.20

Testers (read PLATFORMS.old file)
*********************************

nextime has spent time compiling tcpick on an impressing number of
unix/gnu  platforms helping me understanding tcpick [in]compatibilities

   AdHe5, Alt[O]s, hannibal, Kaioh, Alberto Panu, Maurizio Lemmo
`Tannoiser', Alberto 'JCN-9000' Varesio, gap, Kirillov

   thanks to these people because they spent time testing tcpick on
their unix and linux distros sending me the report, that I used to
complete `PLATFORMS' file.

Thanks
******

Thanks to all people that are using tcpick and are sending me
description of problems encountered and to all people here not mentioned
that contributed to this software in many ways.

   Thanks to sourceforge.net that hosts tcpick, available here:
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpick/'

   Thanks to kuht.it, that is currently hosting tcpick packages at this
url: `http://www.kuht.it/modules/xfmod/project/?tcpick'

   Thanks to all the mantainers of libpcap (`http://www.tcpdump.org'),
that indirectly contributed to the development of tcpick :)

   Thanks to `http://www.linuxlinks.com' webmasters, that have added
tcpick in their directory.
