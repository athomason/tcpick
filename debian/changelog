tcpick (0.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * src/write.c: temporary patch to fix CVE-2006-0048 (Closes: Bug#360571)
    As upstream is not responsive, I have written this one-line patch.
    With the option -yP, tcpick shows data contained in the captured packets.
    For some packets, tcpick computes a negative buffer length, which is used
    in a while (buffer length) {} loop to display the packet content. When the
    buffer length is negative, the loop never ends, and tcpick segfaults after
    a while.
    This patch tests if the computed buffer length is negative before using
    it, and set it to 0 in this case.
