Kirash reported under BSD: 

read() called by pcap_read() called by pcap_loop() blocks the program
until gets about 600.000 byte and then calls got_packet(). Then it
blocks until other 600.000 bytes aren't captured.
It may be a problem of setitimer. If setitimer is set to 2 seconds,
the program works fine, but this is only a workaround.

This seem to be a kernel bug:

Subject: kern/26470: all process stop for a long time by calling
settimeofday() and setitimer()

List: netbsd-bugs

Date: 07/29/2004 04:32:58

[cut]

Description:

All process stops for a long time by calling setitimer() with short
interval and then putting the system clock forward long. 

This bug has been workarounded with a fork + sleep + kill trick.

@item

Segmentation fault in status_switch(): prev->next is null.
I cannot understand this, because the malloc *didn't return NULL*, but a
valid address as gdb said me!. WTF!
NOTE: this is a very rare bug.

Marcos Costantini reported a segmentation fault bug in tcpick running on a
MacOSX system.

Hi..

I've got a tcpdump program running that logs all email to & from the
mail server.

When I use 'tcpick -wR -r log-2004.xx.xx', and look at the resulting
client and server files, there are binary strings stuck in the middle
of
the conversation:

Where are these 'A0 00 00 00 00 00' chunks coming from?  I thought
that -wR was binary-safe.  When I follow the stream using Ethereal, the
problem goes away.

maybe it doesn't go in promisc mode even without -p
