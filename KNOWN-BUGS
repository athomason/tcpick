   *  Kirash reported under BSD:

     read() called by pcap_read() called by pcap_loop() blocks the
     program until gets about 600.000 byte and then calls got_packet().
     Then it blocks until other 600.000 bytes aren't captured.  It may
     be a problem of setitimer. If setitimer is set to 2 seconds, the
     program works fine, but this is only a workaround.

     This seem to be a kernel bug:

     Subject: kern/26470: all process stop for a long time by calling
     settimeofday() and setitimer()

     Description:

     All process stops for a long time by calling setitimer() with short
     interval and then putting the system clock forward long.

     This bug has been workarounded with a fork + sleep + kill trick.

   *  Segmentation fault in status_switch(): prev->next is null.  I
     cannot understand this, because the malloc *didn't return NULL*,
     but a valid address as gdb said me!. WTF!  NOTE: this is a very
     rare bug.

   *  Marcos Costantini reported a segmentation fault bug in tcpick
     running on a MacOSX system.

     Hi..

     I've got a tcpdump program running that logs all email to & from
     the mail server.

     When I use 'tcpick -wR -r log-2004.xx.xx', and look at the
     resulting client and server files, there are binary strings stuck
     in the middle of the conversation:

     [cut]

     Where are these 'A0 00 00 00 00 00' chunks coming from?  I thought
     that -wR was binary-safe.  When I follow the stream using
     Ethereal, the problem goes away.

   *  maybe it doesn't go in promisc mode even without -p
